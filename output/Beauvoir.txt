I read between the lines; it seemed to me that he was answering me, giving me advice; I wrote him love letters; I wrote to him a lot In it suddenly came to me: it seemed to me that God was looking for a woman, that he was going to come and speak to me ; I had the impression he had given me a mission, chosen me to found a temple; I believed myself to be the center of a big complex where doctors would take care of women It was then that I was transferred to the Clermont mental institution There were young doctors who wanted to change the world: in my cabin, I felt their kisses on my fingers, I felt their sex organs in my hands; once, they told me: 'You are not sensitive, but sensual; turn over'; I turned over and I felt them in me: it was very pleasant The head doctor, Dr.…, was like a god; I really felt there was something when he came near my bed; he looked at me as if to say: one day, he looked at me insistently in a truly extraordinary way his green eyes became blue as the sky; they widened intensely in an incredible way he saw the effect that produced all the while speaking to another woman patient and he smiled and I thus remained fixated, fixated on Dr.… one nail does not replace another and in spite of all my lovers (I have had fifteen or sixteen), I could not separate myself from him; that's why he's guilty For more than twelve years, I have been having mental conversations with him when I wanted to forget him, he reappeared he was sometimes a bit mocking ' You see, I frighten you,' he said again, 'you can love others, but you will always come back to me …' I often wrote him letters, even making appointments I would keep.
For Montherlant, the woman lover is just as harmful as the mother; she prevents man from resurrecting the god in himself; woman's lot, he says, is life in its most immediate form, woman lives on feelings, she wallows in immanence; she has a mania for happiness: she wants to trap man in it; she does not experience the lan of her transcendence, she does not have the sense of grandeur; she loves her lover in his weakness and not in his strength, in his troubles and not in his joys; she would like him defenseless, so unhappy as to try to convince him of his misery regardless of any proof to the contrary.
The fact is that this sacrifice appears particularly heavy to men; few of them really wish in their hearts to see women accomplish themselves; those who scorn woman do not see what they would have to gain, and those who cherish her see too well what they have to lose; and it is true that presentday developments not only threaten feminine charm: in deciding to live for herself, woman will abdicate the functions as double and mediator that provide her with her privileged place within the masculine universe; for the man caught between the silence of nature and the demanding presence of other freedoms, a being who is both his peer and a passive thing appears as a great treasure; he may well perceive his companion in a mythical form, but the experiences of which she is the source or pretext are no less real: and there are hardly more precious, intimate, or urgent ones; it cannot be denied that feminine dependence, inferiority, and misfortune give women their unique character; assuredly, women's autonomy, even if it spares men a good number of problems, will also deny them many conveniences; assuredly, there are certain ways of living the sexual adventure that will be lost in the world of tomorrow: but this does not mean that love, happiness, poetry, and dreams will be banished from it.
